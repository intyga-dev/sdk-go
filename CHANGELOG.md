## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0]

Initial public release.

- Client with `Authorize` / `Status` / `Consume` / `RequireApproval`; `Target` is required
  (DIV Target Isolation).
- The public module bundles the offline verifier as the `verify` subpackage, so one `go get`
  covers request and independent receipt verification.
